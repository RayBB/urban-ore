To generate some pixel art examples in my format I used https://onlinepngtools.com/convert-png-to-hex

Then took that array of hexes and converted it to my format with pixel-to-json.html (generated by gemini as well)

I tried quite a few things to get gemini and chatgpt to generate pixel art.
Changing different temperatures, dimensions, and prompts. At the end of the day it really struggled to produce anything decent with this format.


My next idea of waht to do is trying to just give it some pixel art and ask it to generate a similar image based on the prompt. So rather than outputting json it'll output the images.
